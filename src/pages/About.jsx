          Iâ€™m a self-taught React developer who recently completed a 30-day coding challenge called <strong>#30DaysOfReact</strong>. Through this journey, I built projects every day using React Hooks, Routing, Forms, Context API, and more.

          I'm always excited about learning new technologies, solving problems, and building real-world applications.
